<p>Just in time for Mother&#8217;s Day, we have put together some inspiring ways to tell Mom &#8220;thanks for everything&#8221; and for expressing love and gratitude to her.  Weâ€™ll focus on high quality, hand made items, do-it-yourself projects and special recipes. These reflect our commitment to the personal touch&#8211;in our handcrafted linens, our genuine dedication to customer service and our belief that <strong>you</strong> find joy in what comes from heart and hand.</p>
